## EMLD simulator

Development of the simulation tool for Electron Magnetic Linear Dichroism in Transmission Electron Microscopy.

The software was developed by J. Hajduček within his PhD thesis with the great help of Dr. Jan Rusz and under supervision of Dr. Vojtěch Uhlíř.

It is bound to the Dynamical diffraction simulation by [J. Rusz. Ultramicroscopy 177, 20-25 (2017).](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ultramic.2017.01.008)

v01 will contain:
- Visualization of the scattering maps for certain base $M$ directions
- Sample crystal tilt and thickness dependencies of the detected EMLD signal
- Precalculated data for FeRh crystal (assuming Ferromagnetic ordering).

v02 will contain:
- Differentiated antiferromagnet/ferromagnet framework
- Wigner matrix formalism for generalized M evaluation
- Implementation of the spectral profiles present as EMLD

v03 will contain:
- Complete simulation of polycrystalline material
