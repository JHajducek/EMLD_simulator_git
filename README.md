## EMLD simulator v01

Development of the simulation tool for Electron Magnetic Linear Dichroism in Transmission Electron Microscopy.

The software was developed by J. Hajduček within his PhD thesis with the great help of Dr. Jan Rusz and under supervision of Dr. Vojtěch Uhlíř.

It is bound to the Dynamical diffraction simulation by [J. Rusz. Ultramicroscopy 177, 20-25 (2017).](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ultramic.2017.01.008)
